\section{Skillchecks}
To determine wether someone succeeds or fails at a specific task, this ruleset uses a d100 or d\% system. That means you throw a 100 sided die (a so called ''d100'') and try to role a lower or equal number to your skill level to succeed, if you roll a higher number you fail. Since there aren't many d100 around, it is recommended that you roll two 10 sided dice (d10) and declare one as the tens and the other as the ones (before you throw them, of course).
\subsection{Attribute check}
Sometimes you have to check for an attribute directly. In this case you multiply the corresponding attribute by ten and role a d100\footnote{You could just role a d10 against the attribute directly but there are some events and perks that will modify your attribute by less than 10}. Again, the check succeeds if you roll lower or equal to the value and fails  if you roll higher.
\subsection{Critical successes and \mbox{failures}}
Whenever you roll under or equal to a $\frac{1}{10}$ of your original target number, you score a critical success. Critical successes give your weapons more damage, your containers more and more valuable loot and gives you extra options during dialogues, simply put, it makes your success even more better.
In contrary, whenever you roll higher than 89 + the LUCK of the character you are rolling for, it is a critical failure. A critical failure will not only have grave consequences but also prevent any further attempt to succeed in the same matter, e.g. a lock or your gun will jam, a terminal locks down and alarms are sounded.
